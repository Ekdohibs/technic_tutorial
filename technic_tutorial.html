<h1>Starting a new game</h1>
<p>Create a new world, and enable the following mods/modpacks (before entering that world for the first time):</p><ul><li>mesecons</li></ul><ul><li>moreblocks (optional, but needed if you want to use "extranodes")</li></ul><ul><li>moreores</li></ul><ul><li>moretrees</li></ul><ul><li>pipeworks</li></ul><ul><li>plantlife (or at least, plants_lib)</li></ul><ul><li>technic</li></ul><ul><li>unified_inventory</li></ul>
<p></p>
<h1>First steps</h1>
<p><img src="worldcreate.png" width=683 height=384></p>
<p>So, you've just spawned in a wonderful world, and you're probably wondering about what to do. Do as you would do on any map: dig a few trees (don't trash the leaves, they will be useful later), gather some cobble, craft a basic stone pick, and build your house... There are a few points you need to be careful about though: make your house big enough, and easy to extend, since the industry will need a lot of room, and, more importantly, if you decide to mine immediately, do not smelt any of your ore yet, except three iron lumps to craft an iron pick.</p>
<p><img src="house.png" width=683 height=384></p>
<p></p>
<h1>Time to mine!</h1>
<p>Now, gather your torches and pickaxes, and let's go down!</p>
<p><img src="ores1.png" width=683 height=384></p>
<p>Here you can see from left to right:</p><ul><li>Mese crystals</li></ul><ul><li>Tin</li></ul><ul><li>Iron</li></ul><ul><li>Copper (this is the metal you will most lack - not because it's rare, but because it is the most used one)</li></ul><ul><li>Zinc</li></ul>
<p><img src="ores2.png" width=683 height=384></p>
<p>From left to right:</p><ul><li>Iron again</li></ul><ul><li>Coal (don't say it is useless, you will need it...)</li></ul><ul><li>Chromium (generates below -100)</li></ul><ul><li>Gold</li></ul>
<p>Other ores I haven't shown:</p><ul><li>Uranium, a blue-green ore, only generates between -80 and -300</li></ul><ul><li>Mithril, a deep blue ore, generates below -512</li></ul><ul><li>Silver, a grey ore</li></ul><ul><li>Diamond, but you already know it...</li></ul>
<p>So, now you know all the ores, gather: <b>TODO</b></p>
<p>Don't forget that you should not smelt that ore! We will soon see a machine that will be able to produce two ingots for every lump you mine - so if you're too hasty, you will lose metal...</p>
<h1>Your first electric network</h1>
<p>Ok, now you can smelt some of your ore... But don't smelt all of it! Here is what you will need: <b>TODO</b></p>
<p>The base ingredient of electrical circuits is... wires, of course! So, craft <b>TODO</b> wires using the copper ingots.</p>
<p><img src="craft_lv_wire.png" width=683 height=384></p>
<p>To run your circuit, you will also need a switching station - it is the component which will handle all the logic. However, building a switching station is expensive: You will need two wires, two copper ingots, four cast iron ingots and a LV transformer. I'm hearing you saying "Cast iron? What's that?", so let me explain a bit.</p>
<p><img src="craft_switching_station.png" width=683 height=384></p>
<p>In technic, iron has several forms: the first one is wrought iron, which is basically iron, in its ingot form. The second one is cast iron, which is an alloy of iron and carbon, which high carbon content. To get it, just smelt again an ingot of wrought iron; the carbon in the coal will alloy with the iron and form cast iron. There are two other forms of iron, which we will see later.</p>
<p><img src="smelt_cast_iron.png" width=683 height=384></p>
<p>Ok, so now you have to make a LV transformer to build that switching station. But do you know how a transformer is made? It is basically two coils around an iron core. Therefore, you will need seven wrought iron ingots and two coils to make it.</p>
<p><img src="craft_lv_transformer.png" width=683 height=384></p>
<p>Finally, the copper coil. Well, it is but fine wire wrapped <... find better word> around some metal ring. To make it you need fine copper wire and <b>TODO</b> iron.</p>
<p><img src="craft_coil.png" width=683 height=384> <img src="craft_fine_copper_wire.png" width=683 height=384></p>
<p>There it is! You now have your first switching station.</p>
<p><img src="switching_station.png" width=683 height=384></p>
<p>"But", you will say, "what can I do with it now?". Well, to tell the truth: nothing. You need to produce energy in order to be able to do something with your brand new switching station. Therefore, we will craft two more components: the generator and the battery box. What those are used for is self-explainatory: the generator produces energy by burning up fuel, and the battery box can store or give energy to comply with the current energy demand and production.</p>
<p>Firstly, the battery box: for that, you will only need a few batteries and <b>TODO</b>. The batteries aren't hard to craft either: you will just need some <b>TODO</b> and some <b>TODO</b>.</p>
<p><img src="craft_battery.png" width=683 height=384> <img src="craft_battery_box.png" width=683 height=384></p>
<p>Secondly, the generator: you will need <b>TODO</b></p>
<p><img src="craft_generator.png" width=683 height=384></p>
<p>Now, you can make a real circuit. Please note that the switching station needs to be above the wire, whereas the position of other machines relative to the wires has no effect at all.</p>
<p><img src="basic_circuit.png" width=683 height=384></p>
<p>To use the generator, simply put some fuel in its lower slot, and watch the battery box slowly fill up!</p>
<p>"Ok, it's good, but what do we do now?". Well, we use that energy. Remember that machine I told yu about earlier? Well, we're going to build it. Get some desert stone, take a diamond - hey, if it was cheap, it would not be so powerful! - and craft a grinder.</p>
<p><img src="craft_grinder.png" width=683 height=384></p>
<p>Now you can connect the grinder to your electric network, and watch it slowly grind one lump into two dusts, which can each be smelted into an ingot. The grinder has a few other uses too: it can for example grind cobble into sand - ever thought glass was too expensive? It is no longer true! -, or <b>TODO</b> into <b>TODO</b></p>
